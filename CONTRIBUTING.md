# Development environment [`â‡§`](#contents)

Scribe-Server is developed using the [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language. Those new to Go or wanting to develop their skills are more than welcome to contribute! The first step on your Go journey would be to read through the [Go documentation](https://go.dev/doc), with the [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) page in particular having great insights into the language's good practices and standards. The general steps to setting up a development environment are:

1. Download and install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [Scribe-Server repo](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Scribe-Server.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) ðŸ”‘

> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Scribe-Server.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd Scribe-Server
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (Scribe-Server repository)

3. Navigate to the root directory of the project

4. Create a `config.yaml` file with the configuration needed for the project

   - Reference the [`config-example.yaml`](./config-example.yaml) to get started

## Important Note on PATH Configuration for Go Tools

> After installing `Go`, it's highly recommended to add your `Go` binary directory (`$(go env GOPATH)/bin`) to your system's `PATH`. This ensures that tools installed via `go install` (like `swag`, `oapi-codegen`, etc.) are directly accessible from your terminal.

You can typically do this by adding the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`):

```bash
export PATH=$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH
```

After adding this line, remember to apply the changes by sourcing the file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`) or by opening a new terminal session.

5. Install [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/) locally via its [installation guide](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/installing-mariadb/binary-packages).

   - Create a database using the `database.name` value from your `config.yaml` with the following commands (using Homebrew, for example):

   ```bash
   brew services start mariadb
   mariadb -u root  # you may need to sudo this command

   # To stop the server:
   brew services stop mariadb
   ```

   - You can now run the commands found in [CREATE_SCRIBE_SERVER_DB.md](./CREATE_SCRIBE_SERVER_DB.md) to make the needed MariaDB database.

6. Start a local Scribe-Server:

   ```bash
   # Run the following target from the 'Makefile'.
   # Migrate SQLite files from Scribe-Data to MariaDB for use in Scribe-Server:
   make build
   make migrate
   # Start Scribe-Server on your local host:
   make run
   ```

   - NOTE: This `make` target simply runs `go run .` on the project
   - Scribe-Server should now be running locally!

7. To generate the documentation for Scribe-Server, please run the following:

   ```bash
   make docs
   ```

   Once the server is running (via `make run` or `make dev`), you can access the API documentation at:

   - Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html</br>
   - Alternative docs: http://localhost:8080/docs/index.html

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to contact the team in the [Data room on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ScribeData:matrix.org) if you're having problems getting your environment setup!

# Issues and projects [`â‡§`](#contents)

The [issue tracker for Scribe-Server](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/issues) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests). Scribe also organizes related issues into [projects](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/projects).

> [!NOTE]\
> Just because an issue is assigned on GitHub doesn't mean the team isn't open to your contribution! Feel free to write [in the issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/issues) and we can potentially reassign it to you.

Be sure to check the [`-next release-`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/labels/-next%20release-) and [`-priority-`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/labels/-priority-) labels in the [issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/issues) for those that are most important, as well as those marked [`good first issue`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that are tailored for first-time contributors.

<a id="bug-reports"></a>

# Bug reports [`â‡§`](#contents)

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** by trying to reproduce it using the latest `main` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** to make sure that the code in the repository is _definitely_ responsible for the issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (why this might be happening, things tried that didn't work, etc)

To make the above steps easier, the Scribe team asks that contributors report bugs using the [bug report](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=bug_report.yml) template, with these issues further being marked with the [`Bug`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3ABug) type.

Again, thank you for your time in reporting issues!

# Feature requests [`â‡§`](#contents)

Feature requests are more than welcome! Please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. When making a suggestion, provide as much detail and context as possible, and further make clear the degree to which you would like to contribute in its development. Feature requests are marked with the [`Feature`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3AFeature) type, and can be made using the [feature request](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.yml) template.

<a id="pull-requests"></a>

# Pull requests [`â‡§`](#contents)

Good pull requests - patches, improvements and new features - are the foundation of our community making Scribe-Server. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. Note that all contributions to this project will be made under [the specified license](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) and should follow the code style standards ([contact us](https://matrix.to/#/#scribe_community:matrix.org) if unsure).

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (implementing features, refactoring code, etc), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the developers might not want to merge into the project. With that being said, major additions are very appreciated!

When making a contribution, adhering to the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) process is the best way to get your work merged:

1. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

2. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

3. Commit your changes in logical chunks, and please try to adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

> [!NOTE]
> The following are tools and methods to help you write good commit messages âœ¨
>
> - [commitlint](https://commitlint.io/) helps write [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
> - Git's [interactive rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase) cleans up commits

4. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

5. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

6. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.

Thank you in advance for your contributions!

# Data edits [`â‡§`](#contents)

> [!NOTE]\
> Please see the [Wikidata and Scribe Guide](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/WIKIDATAGUIDE.md) for an overview of [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and how Scribe uses it.

Scribe does not accept direct edits to the grammar JSON files as they are sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Edits can be discussed and the [Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data) queries will be changed and ran before an update. If there is a problem with one of the files, then the fix should be made on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and not on Scribe. Feel free to let us know that edits have been made by [opening a data issue](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Server/issues/new?assignees=&labels=data&template=data_wikidata.yml) or contacting us in the [issues for Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues) and we'll be happy to integrate them!

# Deployment testing

This guide explains how to test the GitHub Actions workflow that updates data and deploys to Toolforge via GitHub Actions.

### 1. Generate a New SSH Key (One-Time)

Create a new key pair (without passphrase) specifically for GitHub Actions and Toolforge use:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions-scribe-data" -f ~/.ssh/scribe_toolforge_deploy
```

- Press **Enter** when asked for a passphrase (leave it empty).

### 2. Add Your Public Key to Toolforge

Copy the public key content:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/scribe_toolforge_deploy.pub
```

Then log into Toolforge and add it:

```bash
ssh your-username@login.toolforge.org
become &lt;your-tool-name&gt;
echo "paste-your-public-key-here" &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### 3. Add GitHub Secrets

Copy your private key content:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/scribe_toolforge_deploy
```

In your GitHub repository â†’ **Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions**, add the following:

| Secret Name       |                                               Value |
| :---------------- | --------------------------------------------------: |
| TOOLFORGE_SSH_KEY |            Paste the full output of the private key |
| TOOLFORGE_USER    | Your Toolforge username (e.g. <code>johndoe</code>) |

#### REQUIRED: Also copy public key to Toolforge (for manual SSH if needed), If not the login process will not work!

**ðŸ”‘ Visit your Toolforge account and add your public SSH key at:** [https://toolsadmin.wikimedia.org/profile/settings/ssh-keys/](https://toolsadmin.wikimedia.org/profile/settings/ssh-keys/)

### 4. Run the Workflow

- Go to **GitHub â†’ Actions â†’ "Update Scribe Data and Deploy to Toolforge"**
- Click **"Run workflow"** â†’ Choose branch if needed â†’ **Run workflow**
- Check logs for status and output
